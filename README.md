This repository is a declaration of principles, and a declaration of intent, regarding any and all works released by this [antibrand] program.

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one to dissolve the bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the natural powers to which they are entitled, a decent respect to the opinions of others requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident:

* That all people are created equal, that they are endowed by universal law with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, expression, assembly, and the pursuit of happiness.

* That to secure these rights, ideas are instituted among people, deriving their just validity from peacable, respectful, and voluntary participation.

* That whenever any institution or establishment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of individuals to dissociate from it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
